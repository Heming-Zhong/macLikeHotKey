# macLikeHotKey
A macOS-Like Key-Mapping for Windows 10 based on autohotkey

## Usage & Features

note: this self-use keymapping is based on this repo <u>https://github.com/stroebjo/autohotkey-windows-mac-keyboard</u> in addition with some custom config and improvements. Changes below are included or to be included:

- [x] line start and line end using `CMD/WIN + Left` and `CMD/WIN + Right`

- [x] line delete using `CMD/WIN + BackSpace`

- [x] line selection using `CMD/WIN + SHIFT + Left` and `CMD/WIN + SHIFT + Left`

- [x] `CMD/WIN + F1-5` for custom app launchers

- [x] custom `CMD/WIN + b`, `CMD/WIN + j`, `CMD/WIN + /` key for vscode sidebar, built-in terminal and fast comment

- [ ] using `ALT` for word-based cursor actions

- [ ] `CMD/WIN + SHIFT + 5` for fast screen recording

## Things you need to know

1. This is a self-use keymapping config. It works perfectly for **MY WIN10 COMPUTER**, but it may not work well on Other environment. 
2. Be that as it may, feel free to raise an issue.
3. custom app launchers launch apps with the paths on MY PC, so you might need to change the executable path to your own in order to make it work.
4. As mentioned above, it's a self-use script so it won't be 100% the same as the system keymappings on macOS. If you just don't like the customed part, feel free to fork and modify one of your own.
5. There might be a "pure mac-Like" version in the future.
6. Finally, any contribution are welcomed.
